<p>Across the crowd,
</br>you stare at me.</p>

<p>My face flushes
</br>to a warm red;
</br>I break out a smile.</p>

<p>As you move
</br>towards me,
</br>the crowd
</br>vanishes in thin air.</p>

<p>The beating of my heart,
</br>quickens;
</br>the bones in my body,
</br>shiver.</p>

<p>My hands stretch out
</br>for an embrace;
</br>you pass right through me.</p>

<p>I’ve been a ghost all along.</p>
