<p>Dear Sappho</p>
<p>My breath is broken</p>
<p>by a hundred thousand words</p>
<p>arranged in endless spirals</p>
<p>and yet</p>
<p>I cannot describe them as you do</p>
<p>As nymphs</p>
<p>stretched out on satin sheets</p>
<p>As pure light</p>
<p>As joy reflected upon itself</p>
<p>I cannot transform them into goddesses</p>
<p>clothed in naked verse</p>
<p>Not the way you can</p>
<p>dear Sappho</p>
