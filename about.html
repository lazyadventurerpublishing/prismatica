<div class="about">
  <p><i>Prismatica Magazine</i> is a weekly LGBTQ fantasy and science fiction magazine published by Lazy Adventurer Publishing. The magazine has its beginnings in June of 2018 and is currently open for submissions. <i>Prismatica</i> features short fiction and poetry by both emerging and established, self-identified LGBTQ writers. In the magazine’s stories and poems, readers can find fantasy and science-fiction of all sub-genres and cross-genres. We happily include magical realism, contemporary science-fiction, urban fantasy, and more.</p>
  <p><i>Prismatica Magazine</i> was started by Andrew Olvera and Matthew Gustavson, who act as the magazine’s duel editors-in-chief. Our grassroots literary magazine was created after Lazy Adventurer Publishing’s initial foray in to publishing with <i>Creative Realms Magazine</i>. After this introduction to the publishing world we realized the need for a community of LGBTQ+ writers, focused primarily on genre fiction. Every member of our small staff fits somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum. All of whom are fully dedicated to nurturing a community where everyone of all walks of life can feel included in genre fiction.</p>
  <p>The stories found within the magazine often push the boundary or feature raw emotions and complex themes. Though perhaps most importantly, every piece of fiction is meant to let anyone and everyone on the LGBTQ+ spectrum feel welcome within the genres of fantasy and science-fiction. This is particularly dear to the hearts of the <i>Prismatica</i> team as our own experiences have shown us that these genres in particular are where the LGBTQ+ community can often feel left out. It is to this end, inclusion and celebration, that <i>Prismatica Magazine</i> was created.</p>
  <p>You can read <i>Prismatica Magazine</i> online in its entirety for free in text form on our website. Additionally, each piece published receives a dramatic reading by a member of our team. These readings can be found on Spotify, iTunes, GooglePlay, and YouTube.</p>
