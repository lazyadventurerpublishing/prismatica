<p>I tried hard
</br>to keep my buds enclosed,
</br>hiding the hues within.</p>

<p>Along the breeze
</br>I sway,
</br>like the rest
</br>of the plants
</br>in this flower bed.</p>

<p>Petals wither,
</br>stifling my throat,
</br>but I am not ready
</br>to show everyone
</br>my true colours.</p>

<p>Underneath
</br>the roots are dying,
</br>killing my stem
</br>bit by bit,
</br>until I am unable
</br>to hold my petals inside,
</br>choking them out
</br>as I sigh
</br>one last breath.</p>
</br>
