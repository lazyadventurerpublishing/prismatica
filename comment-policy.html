    <h3><i>Prismatica Magazine</i>'s Comment Policy</h3>
    <p>Since "don't be a dick" isn't, well, a very good guideline on how to comment, <i>Prismatica Magazine</i> has put together a comment policy for which to comply.</p>
    <p>Please refrain from the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal attacks against another commenter or the writer of the post/website. This can run from name calling to sentences which include the words “people like you” or statements which begin “I bet you” or “you must/probably” etc.</li>
      <li>Hate speech or other clearly intentional jerk behavior. This includes racist, gendered, ableist, homophobic and transphobic slurs and language of any sort.</li>
      <li>Every interpretation of spamming is prohibited. This means no unauthorized advertisements, links to any kind of online gambling, game currency sellers, follower sellers, self-promotion of mobile games, YouTube channels or unsanctioned crowdfunding, and charity efforts** are to be posted in the comments.</li>
    </ul>
