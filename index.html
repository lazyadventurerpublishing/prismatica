    <h3>Editor's Desk: August</h3>
    <p>Back in May, a good friend of mine and I created an online magazine called Collective Realms Magazine which was intended to share the short fiction written by a roleplaying group that we've been a part of for a few years now.</p>

    <p>It has been good so far, running a magazine, but we didn't stop there. We had the idea to create a magazine to center around the LGBTQ community within the genres of fantasy and science fiction. This wouldn't be a small project for just us and a small(ish) group of people but an actual magazine we want to make for the public at large.</p>

    <p>So, now we're starting that magazine. Prismatica Magazine, an LGBTQ Fantasy & Science Fiction magazine. To be honest, I wouldn't have thought it possible to be doing this even a few months ago, but with a small, yet amazing, team of people, we're making it official.</p>

    <p>I have been in love with writing and creating stories since as far back as I can remember and now, being able to create this magazine and have the potential to share like-minded individuals' stories brings me a tremendous joy. Soon, we will have the website up and running, but for now please like and follow our page for news as we get everything settled.</p>
