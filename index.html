    <h3>Editor's Desk: January</h3>
    <p>Welcome 2019! It's a new year, so get out there and write! Whether you made a resolution or not, we can't wait to see what you produce in this new year. Also, remember that we love to read and share the stories of the Collective Iconics and all of the other characters that exist within our "Collectiverse", so everyone is encouraged to submit their work!</p>

    <h3>Free Edit Month</h3>
    <p>If you are participating in NaNoWriMo, Prismatica is offering a Free Editing Month throughout the month of December. The editing staff will edit any and all submissions that are sent in! Make sure you let us know in the email that the submission is for our Editing Month. If you are doing short story compilations, you can send a story, and if you are doing a novel, you can send in up to a full chapter.</p>
    <p>An editor will work directly with you, the author, on big picture stuff (developmental editing) where we help you build up your plot, work on characters, or anything else you want. Let us know if there is anything in particular you want us to work with you on, otherwise we will do a more generic development edit. Additionally, we will work on smaller things like line editing, to include sentence structure and grammatical errors.</p>
    <p>This may take time, depending on how many submissions we receive, but we will edit anything sent to us that does not violate our submission guidelines. We will be working on submissions in the order that they are received and we will email you with updates along the way. Send in submissions as you would one to be published, indicating that it is for editing week as well as what type of editing you would like to be done (you can even choose both!).</p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing your work!</p>
