    <h3>Editor's Desk: August</h3>
    <p>We are heading into the month of August, which means that we've been running for a little over one month now. I honestly can't believe how far we've come since developing the concept of the magazine in May, to estabishing the website in late-June, to pushing out our first story.</p>
    <p><i>Collective Realms Magazine</i> is currently two stories in with two more currently in development. We are going to continue on the set track of posting every two weeks, so keep a look out for the stories to come. The members of the Collective are a talented bunch who really deserve a lot of recognition. If you can take the time, please leave comments letting them know what you think. They put a lot of hard work into writing their stories, and I believe it shows.</p>
    <p>I'd like to end with thanking all of our readers for being the encouragement we need in developing the magazine. I also want to personally thank my editing staff for their hard work in getting these stories published, and our podcasting staff in establishing our podcast. I am truly honored to be working among so many talented individuals. Thank you for letting me be your co-editor-in-chief.</p>
