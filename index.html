    <h3>Editor's Desk: November</h3>
    <p>Fall is here, and so is NaNoWriMo! If you're participating, give us a shoutout on Twitter, Facebook, or Tumblr and we'll send you an invite to Prismatica Magazine's private discord where you can talk to like-minded individuals, as well as communicate directly with Prismatica's staff members! Then, at the end of the month, Prismatica will be hosting another Free Editing period for the entire month of December, where we will edit your work. If you are doing short story compilations, you can send a story, and if you are doing a novel, you can send in up to a full chapter.</p>
    <p>Also, November 6th is Election Day! If you are an American, please don't forget to vote! If you aren't, have a wonderful, ordinary Tuesday!</p>
    <p>Kindest regards, </p>

    <h3>Free Edit Week</h3>
    <p>Hey there! Have a piece of fiction that you think just isn’t quite ready to be published? For one week only, from September 1st through the 7th, the editing staff will edit any and all submissions that are sent in! Make sure you let us know in the email that the submission is for our Editing Week.</p>
    <p>An editor will work directly with you, the author, on big picture stuff (developmental editing) where we help you build up your plot, work on characters, or anything else you want. Let us know if there is anything in particular you want us to work with you on, otherwise we will do a more generic development edit. Additionally, we will work on smaller things like line editing, to include sentence structure and grammatical errors.</p>
    <p>This may take time, depending on how many submissions we receive, but we will edit anything sent to us that does not violate our submission guidelines. We will be working on submissions in the order that they are received and we will email you with updates along the way. Send in submissions as you would one to be published, indicating that it is for editing week as well as what type of editing you would like to be done (you can even choose both!).</p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing your work!</p>
