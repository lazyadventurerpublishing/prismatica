<p>Autumn morning, cloudy skies,
</br>cold chills run through the air
</br>between these humid walls.</p>

<p>I breathe serenity,
</br>my bare feet stand on marble tiles
</br>stealing heat like thieves.</p>

<p>Unchain myself out of the shackles
</br>that have constricted my body;
</br>bruises imprinted on my back,
</br>frail bones tremble.</p>

<p>Throw myself into damp soil,
</br>soaked by muddy terrain.
</br>Ready. I think Iâ€™m ready.</p>

<p>Skin turns green,
</br>energy spouts from within,
</br>leaves whirl around
</br>my humble flesh.</p>
