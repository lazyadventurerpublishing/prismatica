<p>I only knew life
</br>inside a zoo’s unkempt cell.</p>

<p>An unexpected man 
</br>was bold enough to risk his life;
</br>he unlocked my gate.
</br>I followed him home
</br>like a loyal puppy.</p>

<p>I got lured me into his web of lies,
</br>I could not untangle myself.</p>

<p>He devoured my hope
</br>and spit it back in my face.
</br>As my body was drained dry,
</br>he kicked me out in the street:
</br>an emaciated body
</br>crawling to the gates of hell.</p>
