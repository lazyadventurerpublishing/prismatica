   <p>We publish every issue of <i>Prismatica</i> online for free. We count on our readers and listeners to help support our efforts. Through Patreon, you can do just that:</p>
   
   <p><strong>What will we do with your contributions?</strong></p>
   <ul>
      <li>Be able to pay those writers for their work! We would love to be able to pay our writers for their work and with your support, we can do so.</li>
      <li>Maintain our website and podcast, which features our fiction in audio format.</li>
      <li>Create an e'zine that can be delivered electronically so that our content can be accessed away from your browser.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Our staff works entirely on a voluntary basis. Any contributions will be put directly back into the magazine itself to continue creating Prismatica, to include finding, publishing, and housing quality LGBTQ fiction for everyone.</p>
