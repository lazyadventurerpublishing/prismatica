   <p><i>Prismatica Magazine</i> is looking for character-oriented stories. While <i>Prismatica Magazine</i> does not immediately deny stories with adult themes, works with excessive explicit material will need to be edited to the satisfaction of our editorial staff.</p>
   <p>Stories should be well-written, easily read on-screen, and effective in audio format. Genres that lie anywhere within the confines of fantasy or science-fiction are accepted, even “light” genres such as contemporary or urban fantasy with low-magic settings.</p>
   <p>All submissions must be from self-identified LGBTQ+ members, though some exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis. If your story does not feature characters that identify somewhere on the LGBTQ+ spectrum, your story likely isn’t for us. This includes instances of “oh, they were gay the whole time, it just didn’t come up”. Stories from diverse perspectives and under-represented groups, settings, and cultures are gladly accepted, as are stories that discuss political and social issues.</p>
   <p>We do not accept stories over 10,000 words or partial/incomplete stories. We do not feature serialized fiction, nor will we ask for the rest of the piece if it is not submitted in its entirety. Stories we likely will not accept include those about abusers or murderers (written as the protagonist), stories that are clearly about your Dungeons and Dragons campaign, or stories that paint any religion as the bad guy for edginess’s sake.</p>
