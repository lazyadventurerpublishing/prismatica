<p>RIP Walt Whitman</p>
<h3>1. fuck my life</h3>
<p>oy
</br>fml+
</br>gender
</br>fluidity,
</br>clusterfuck
</br>guilt my time
</br>is, younger bro
</br>error perished on
</br>borrowed chopper
</br>that day before I made
</br>it back home to Jerusalem
</br>last Passover - for this year
</br>the new non-stop flight from SF
</br>meant way easier with toddler tyke
</br>plus our beacon Ima had shut off, now's
</br>turned back on again littlest bits with a grin
</br>even laughs every once in a blue Israeli moon
</br>while Abba, drab cucumber he always appears,
</br>remains so inscrutable whether there's any grief,
</br>whilst younger sister, whom each parent has loved
</br>and will support although really deeply disappointed
</br>she was trans, seems their one mourning loneliest by far -- 
</br>whereas baby girl of family, just completed some alternative
</br>to avoid military service, must be strong since both boys gone</p>



<h3>2. Ginsbergian Successor Poems</h3>
<h4>i. Terrorists Are Our Time's Graffiti Artists.</h4>
<p>Eyeball plucked out with a spoon, score a smiley on her torturer's mask.</p>
<p>For the aloof wife of a rebel leader, cracking up is a godsend.</p>
<p>Just fanatics and the hum of the frig which contains half-drunk sodas,</p>
<p>kaleidoscope on the fritz -- would give hubby up for a smoke, or two</p>
<p>--she woofs out, <i>Ayman Zawahiri is Allen Ginsberg in disguise!</i></p>
<p><i>That queer Jew-dog ex-ad man's gray flannel suit's just what al Qaeda needs!</i></p>

<h4>ii. Ex-Hassid's Chimeric Ginsbergoid Brooklyn</h4>
<p>Tunnel of weirdnesses some like my once leontine cousin</p>
<p>enter while other serpent-tailed imps</p>
<p>exit -- dropping tiny kazoos in shofars,</p>
<p>they form their new old-fangled klezmer band of golems.</p>

<h4>iii. Rich & Happy Perpetrator's Victims</h4>
<p>Brassy</p>
<p>Cisterns of oppositional kinky spindle</p>
<p>Artifacts</p>
<p>Repair towards earth balcony smoking</p>
<p>Weed</p>
<p>Then proceed into crisis of late-stage</p>
<p>Capitalism/</p>
<p>Nukes-climate-bioterror apocalypses:</p>
<p>Flippant ---</p>
<p>There is an urge to indulge in badness.</p>
<p>Mirth</p>

<h3>3. Prospecti and Perspectives</h3>
<h4>iv. For U.S. Growth Industry Investments</h4>
<p>Life is just a bowl of cherries
</br>now discarded by rich folk
</br>rotting in this city dump
</br>to our immediate left</p>

<p>or forced first time anal sex
</br>in a primarily dark people
</br>county penitentiary cell
</br>to that <i>excremento</i> right</p>

<p>or simply good old-fashioned
</br>man-rapes-child happening
</br>all the time in homeless
</br>camps tucked between</p>

<p>where your or my vets, mentally ill,
</br>addicted, unemployed brethren
</br>can't cope get flushed down
</br>expanding for-profit toilets.</p>
