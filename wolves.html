<p>Daunting — to walk naked among wolves,
</br>their jaws quiver in excitement,
</br>their fangs whiter than snow,
</br>drenched in drool, ready for dinner.</p>

<p>A growling pack 
</br>circling this bare body
</br>as it lays in front of them
emitting an intense odour of fear.</p>

<p>I close my wandering eyes
</br>as I wonder:
	</br>will they embrace me in their silken fur
	</br>or will they gnaw me like yesterday’s meal?
		</br>Either way,
		</br>I’ll never see them coming.</p>

</br>
