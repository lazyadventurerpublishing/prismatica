<p>Daunting — to walk naked among wolves,</p>
<p>their jaws quiver in excitement,</p>
<p>their fangs whiter than snow,</p>
<p>drenched in drool, ready for dinner.</p>
</br>
<p>A growling pack </p>
<p>circling this bare body</p>
<p>as it lays in front of them</p>
<p>emitting an intense odour of fear.</p>
</br>
<p>I close my wandering eyes</p>
<p>as I wonder:</p>
	<p class="tab"><i>will they embrace me in their silken fur</i></p>
	<p class="tab"><i>or will they gnaw me like yesterday’s meal?</i></p>
		<p>Either way,</p>
		<p>I’ll never see them coming.</p>
